# rest_api
this is my 'hello world' app. adjust expectations accordingly.

I'm using the Tableau Software Rest API and the tkinter library to cobble together my first python application.

Over time I will be adding more functionalities, improving the UI and UX.

If you'd like to show me a thing or two, please fork.  I'd like to keep some continuity with my learning.
